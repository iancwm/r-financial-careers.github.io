# Part I: The Corporate Segment
The Corporate segment is where finance professionals work directly within a non-financial company (e.g., a tech company, a retailer, an energy firm). Their primary goal is not to advise external clients for a fee but to manage the company's internal finances and drive its growth from within.
## Corporate Development (Corp Dev)
This is the in-house mergers and acquisitions (M&A) team for a company. The core function of a Corp Dev professional is to identify, evaluate, and execute acquisitions, joint ventures, and partnerships that will help their own company grow. They essentially act as the company's in-house investment bankers.

Explicitly for Graduates: No. Graduate recruitment for Corporate Development is rare. The path to this role is almost always via a few years of experience in Investment Banking or a similar deal-focused role.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is the most common and effective way to switch into Corporate Development. Most firms hire at the post-MBA Associate level.
Day-to-Day Activities: The work is very similar to a buy-side M&A deal at an investment bank. Junior professionals spend their time on deal sourcing, research, financial modeling, and due diligence. They work on a single company's deals and often get to see the process through from start to finish, including post-merger integration. At smaller companies, the role can be more "random," covering a wider range of business development and strategy tasks.
Required Skills: You need to be a deal generalist with a strong understanding of your company's industry. Technical skills in valuation and modeling are essential, as is the ability to run a deal independently. On the soft skills side, you must be a great communicator and a persistent problem-solver, capable of navigating internal bureaucracy to get a deal done.
Lifestyle & Hours: The lifestyle is generally much better than in a client-facing role at a bank. While deals still require long hours, it's typically more manageable and predictable than the investment banking grind.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is significantly lower than in investment banking or private equity, and career advancement can be slower due to lower turnover. The most common exit opportunity is to a private equity firm, especially for a Private Equity Analyst role, given the strong deal experience. It is a less direct path to public markets roles.

## Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)
This career path is the financial backbone of a company's operations. FP&A professionals work with business leaders across the company to forecast financial performance, analyze budgets, and support strategic decision-making. Their goal is to ensure the company stays on track to hit its financial targets.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. Many large corporations have formal graduate programs or entry-level roles for FP&A.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA can help with a career switch into a senior FP&A role.
Day-to-Day Activities: A junior FP&A professional's day involves building financial models, preparing quarterly forecasts, analyzing variances between actual and planned performance, and creating presentations for management. They often work on a specific business unit, giving them deep knowledge of its operations.
Required Skills: You need strong quantitative and analytical skills. Proficiency in Excel is a must, and experience with enterprise planning software (e.g., Anaplan, Hyperion) is a plus. Soft skills like communication, attention to detail, and the ability to work collaboratively with non-finance teams are crucial.
Lifestyle & Hours: This role generally offers a great work-life balance, with a standard 40-50 hour work week. Hours can increase during budget season or quarter-end, but this is usually predictable.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is lower than in client-facing finance, but the work-life balance is a major trade-off. FP&A can be a stepping stone to other corporate finance roles, such as Treasury or Investor Relations, or even a senior leadership role within a business unit.

## Treasury
Treasury professionals are responsible for a company's liquid assets. They manage cash flow, corporate financing, and financial risk (e.g., currency and interest rate risk). Their goal is to ensure the company has the liquidity it needs to operate and invest while minimizing financial risk.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. Many large companies offer formal graduate training programs in their Treasury departments.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA can help with a career switch into Treasury, particularly at the senior level.
Core Function: To manage the company's money. This includes managing cash flow, overseeing working capital, securing short-term and long-term financing, and hedging against financial risks like currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Day-to-Day Activities: Daily tasks include managing bank accounts, forecasting cash needs, and working with banks to secure financing. A significant portion of the work involves financial risk management, where you might use derivatives to hedge against changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
Required Skills: You need to have strong quantitative and analytical skills, as well as a solid understanding of macroeconomics. Knowledge of financial products like bonds, commercial paper, and derivatives is essential. You must also be detail-oriented and have good communication skills to work with banks and internal stakeholders.
Lifestyle & Hours: Treasury roles generally offer a stable, predictable lifestyle with standard working hours.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is in line with other corporate finance roles. Common exit opportunities include moving to a corporate banking group at a financial institution or taking a more senior role in treasury at a larger company.

# Part II: The Sell-Side Segment
The Sell-Side refers to financial institutions that create, sell, and trade securities and provide advisory services to companies. Their primary goal is to generate revenue by serving clients. This segment includes investment banks and brokerage firms.

## Investment Banking (M&A)
This is the "classic" investment banking role. M&A bankers advise companies on major transactions like selling their business or acquiring another one. They are the dealmakers of the finance world.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. Investment banks have highly structured graduate programs and summer internships that are the primary entry point for this role.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is the most common and effective way to switch careers into Investment Banking at the Associate level.
Core Function: To provide strategic and financial advice to clients on mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.
Day-to-Day Activities: As an Analyst or Associate, your life is a whirlwind of Excel and PowerPoint. You'll build financial models, create pitch books for prospective clients, and manage the complex process of a deal. The work is highly project-based and can be unpredictable.
Required Skills: You need to be a master of financial modeling and valuation. Attention to detail is paramount. You also need the stamina and resilience to work long, unpredictable hours under pressure.
Lifestyle & Hours: This is the most demanding lifestyle in finance, with 80+ hour work weeks and frequent all-nighters.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: While the hours are grueling, the compensation is very high. M&A is often considered the "king of exit opportunities," providing a direct path to prestigious buy-side roles like private equity.

## Corporate Banking
Often confused with investment banking, Corporate Banking focuses on providing traditional lending and banking services to corporations. Think of it as the "relationship" side of the bank.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. Most large banks offer formal graduate programs for Corporate Banking.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA can help with a career switch into Corporate Banking, especially for Relationship Manager roles.
Core Function: To manage the banking relationship with large corporations by providing services like loans, credit facilities, and other traditional banking products.
Day-to-Day Activities: This role involves financial statement analysis and credit analysis to determine a company's creditworthiness. Junior professionals help prepare credit applications and manage the ongoing relationship with the client. The work is less about M&A deals and more about long-term client management.
Required Skills: You need a strong understanding of credit and accounting. Relationship-building and communication skills are also crucial. The role is less technical than M&A and more focused on credit fundamentals.
Lifestyle & Hours: The lifestyle is far more manageable than in investment banking, with a predictable 50-60 hour work week.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is lower than in investment banking, but it's a stable and well-compensated career. Common exit opportunities include Corporate Treasury, credit analysis at a credit rating agency, or a senior role in a non-bank financial institution.

## Restructuring
Restructuring professionals are brought in when a company is in financial distress. They act as financial advisors to either the company or its creditors to help navigate a bankruptcy or a financial turnaround.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. Some investment banks and boutique advisory firms have analyst programs that focus specifically on Restructuring, often as a part of their broader investment banking division.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is a very common and effective way to switch into Restructuring at the Associate level.
Core Function: To advise financially distressed companies or their creditors on capital structure adjustments, bankruptcy, and financial turnarounds.
Day-to-Day Activities: This is a high-stress, high-impact role. You'll spend your time modeling complex capital structures, negotiating with creditors, and preparing for court proceedings. The work is highly analytical and requires a deep understanding of debt, credit, and legal frameworks.
Required Skills: Strong financial modeling and legal knowledge are essential. You must have a strong stomach for high-stakes negotiations and be able to work under intense pressure.
Lifestyle & Hours: The hours are often as demanding as M&A, as the work is time-sensitive and critical.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is typically very high due to the specialized and high-impact nature of the work. Restructuring provides a strong foundation for a career in distressed debt, private credit, or special situations funds.

## Equity Research
Equity Research Analysts work at investment banks or independent research firms and are responsible for analyzing public companies and issuing stock recommendations (Buy, Sell, or Hold) to institutional investors.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. Many banks have structured graduate programs for Equity Research, often tied to a broader Markets and Research track.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is a common way to switch into Equity Research, particularly for a senior-level analyst role.
Core Function: To provide in-depth analysis and investment recommendations on public companies.
Day-to-Day Activities: Junior analysts (Associates) spend their days building financial models, writing research reports, and updating their models based on company news and earnings. Senior analysts spend more time speaking with management and investors to gain insights and build relationships.
Required Skills: A passion for the public markets is essential. You need strong financial analysis and modeling skills, as well as excellent written and verbal communication to articulate your investment theses.
Lifestyle & Hours: The hours are generally better than in investment banking but can be long and unpredictable around earnings season.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is competitive but generally lower than in M&A. Equity research is a strong stepping stone to roles in Asset Management, Hedge Funds, or Investor Relations.

## Credit Rating Agencies
Credit Rating Agencies (e.g., Moody's, S&P) are the gatekeepers of the credit world. They analyze a company's or government's financial health and assign a credit rating that reflects the likelihood of default.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. These agencies have formal graduate programs that serve as the primary entry point for a career in credit analysis.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA can help with a career switch, allowing you to enter at a more senior level with a broader understanding of finance.
Core Function: To provide an objective assessment of the creditworthiness of companies and governments.
Day-to-Day Activities: Junior analysts analyze financial statements and industry trends, participate in meetings with management, and help write the reports that justify their ratings. The work is highly structured and research-intensive.
Required Skills: You need to have a very strong understanding of accounting and credit analysis. Attention to detail and good writing skills are crucial.
Lifestyle & Hours: This is a highly stable career with a strong work-life balance and a standard 40-50 hour work week.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is generally lower than in client-facing roles. Common exit opportunities include Corporate Treasury, corporate banking, or portfolio management at an asset manager that focuses on fixed income.

## Sales & Trading (S&T)
Sales & Trading professionals act as market-makers, buying and selling financial products (e.g., stocks, bonds, currencies, derivatives) for institutional clients or for their firm's own account.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. S&T has well-defined graduate programs and summer internships that are the primary entry point.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is a common way to switch into S&T, particularly for a sales or structuring role.
Core Function: To provide liquidity to the markets and facilitate trades for clients and the firm. The "Sales" side builds client relationships, while the "Trading" side executes the trades.
Day-to-Day Activities: The day starts early with market analysis and ends when the markets close. Traders spend their time executing orders and managing risk, while salespeople are constantly on the phone with clients, pitching trade ideas and taking orders. The work is fast-paced and requires a great deal of real-time decision-making.
Required Skills: You need to have quick reflexes, strong mental math skills, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. You must also have a deep understanding of financial products and market dynamics. Sales roles require excellent interpersonal and relationship-building skills.
Lifestyle & Hours: While demanding, the hours are much more predictable than in investment banking. The work day is tied to market hours, which allows for more personal time in the evenings.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is highly variable and directly tied to performance. The pay can be very high, especially for top traders. Common exit opportunities include moving to a hedge fund (especially macro or quantitative funds), a prop trading firm, or an Investor Relations role.

# Part III: The Buy-Side Segment
The Buy-Side is where firms invest capital on behalf of clients or for their own account. Their primary goal is to generate returns on investment. This segment includes private equity firms, asset managers, and venture capital firms.

## Private Equity (PE)
Private Equity firms raise capital from wealthy individuals and institutions and invest it in private companies. They aim to improve the company's operations over a period of years and then sell it for a significant profit.

Explicitly for Graduates: No. Private Equity firms almost exclusively hire their junior staff from top-tier Investment Banking programs, typically after two years of experience.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is a very common and effective way to switch into Private Equity at the Associate or Vice President level, though a pre-MBA background in a related field is often required.
Core Function: To invest in and actively manage private companies to create value and generate returns for investors.
Day-to-Day Activities: The work is very deal-oriented. Junior professionals spend their time on financial modeling (especially complex LBO models), due diligence, and preparing presentations for investment committees. They work on a small number of deals but with incredible depth.
Required Skills: You need to be an expert in financial modeling and valuation. Critical thinking is paramount, as you must be able to form a strong, independent investment thesis. You also need to be an energetic self-starter.
Lifestyle & Hours: The work is demanding, with long hours, but it's typically more project-based than in investment banking.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is very high, with the potential for "carry," or a share of the fund's profits, at senior levels. PE is considered a top-tier destination for investment bankers. Exit opportunities are diverse, including senior roles at portfolio companies, or moving to a hedge fund or venture capital firm.

## Asset Management
Asset Management firms manage portfolios of public securities (stocks, bonds) for institutional and individual clients. Unlike hedge funds, they often have a more diversified, long-term, and passive investment strategy.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes, but it's competitive. Some large asset managers offer graduate programs, but entry is highly competitive. Many firms prefer to hire from Investment Banking or Equity Research.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is a common way to switch into Asset Management, especially for a portfolio management or senior analyst role.
Core Function: To manage public investment portfolios (e.g., mutual funds, pension funds) to achieve specific return objectives for clients.
Day-to-Day Activities: Junior professionals spend their time on fundamental research, financial modeling, and preparing investment memos. Senior professionals (Portfolio Managers) are responsible for making the final investment decisions.
Required Skills: A passion for the public markets and a deep understanding of fundamental analysis are crucial. You need to be a long-term thinker and a patient researcher.
Lifestyle & Hours: This career path offers an excellent work-life balance, with a standard 50-60 hour work week.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is competitive, but the bonus is generally less a function of individual performance and more a function of the firm's performance. The most common exit opportunity is to a hedge fund, or to a senior investment role at a different asset manager.

## Venture Capital (VC)
Venture Capital firms raise capital to invest in early-stage, high-growth, private companies. They are the investors who fund startups with the potential to become the next Google or Facebook.

Explicitly for Graduates: No. Venture Capital firms almost never hire directly out of undergraduate programs. Junior roles are typically filled by former Investment Banking or Management Consulting analysts.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is a very common and effective way to switch into VC, often at the Associate or Principal level.
Core Function: To invest in high-risk, high-reward early-stage companies and provide them with the capital and guidance needed to grow.
Day-to-Day Activities: Junior VC professionals spend their time "sourcing," which means finding and meeting with promising startups. They also conduct due diligence and help prepare investment memos. Unlike PE, the work is less focused on financial modeling and more on market analysis and networking.
Required Skills: You need to have an extreme passion for the startup ecosystem. A keen eye for market trends and strong networking skills are more important than being a "number cruncher."
Lifestyle & Hours: VC is a "get rich slowly" job. The hours are generally manageable, but a significant portion of your time is spent on networking and building relationships outside the office.
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is significantly lower than in Private Equity, especially at the junior level, but the long-term upside can be massive through "carry." Exit opportunities are limited but are well-aligned with the startup ecosystem.

## Private Banking (PB) / Private Wealth Management (PWM)
Private bankers manage financial assets for high-net-worth (HNW) and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals and families, and handle other financial matters such as tax, estate, and philanthropic planning, in exchange for fees on managed assets.

Explicitly for Graduates: Yes. Many large banks have graduate programs for their private banking and wealth management divisions.
MBA for a Career Switch: Yes, an MBA is a common path to switch into this field, often at the Relationship Manager level.
Core Function: To manage financial assets and provide comprehensive financial planning for wealthy clients.
Day-to-Day Activities: The roles are generally split between Relationship Managers (RMs) who focus on client acquisition and maintenance, and Investment Professionals (IPs) who manage the portfolios. It's a client-facing, sales-oriented role with a lot of networking.
Required Skills: This is a sales job at its core, requiring strong client interaction, an outgoing personality, and the ability to build and maintain relationships over the long term. Knowledge of a wide range of asset classes is also important.
Lifestyle & Hours: The lifestyle is generally excellent, with a typical work week of around 50 hours, though you are "always at the whim of your clients."
Compensation & Exit Opportunities: Compensation is lower than in deal-based finance but can be very high for top performers who build a large book of clients. Exit opportunities are limited to other client-facing roles.
